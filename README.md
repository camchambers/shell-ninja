# Shell Ninja
A collection of custom shell commands and functions that I have collected and created over the years. 

# Installation

1. Clone the repo (ie. into your home directory)
```bash
cd ~
git clone git@github.com:camchambers/shell-ninja.git
```

2. Source the script from your shell profile

```bash
# Bash Example
echo "source ~/shell-ninja/.sn" >> ~/.bash_profile
```

```bash
# Zsh Example
echo "source ~/shell-ninja/.sn" >> ~/.zshenv
```
